**ARIA** (_Accessible Rich Internet Applications_) is a {{Glossary("W3C")}} specification for adding semantics and other metadata to HTML to cater to users of assistive technology.

For example, you could add the attribute `role="alert"` to a {{HTMLElement("p")}} tag to notify a sight-challenged user that the information is important and time-sensitive (which you might otherwise convey through text color).
