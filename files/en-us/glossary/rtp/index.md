The **Real-time Transport Protocol** (**RTP**) is a network protocol which described how to transmit various media (audio, video) from one endpoint to another in a real-time fashion. RTP is suitable for video-streaming application, telephony over IP like Skype and conference technologies.

The secure version of RTP, **SRTP**, is used by WebRTC, and uses encryption and authentication to minimize the risk of denial-of-service attacks and security breaches.

RTP is rarely used alone; instead, it is used in conjunction with other protocols like RTSP and SDP.
