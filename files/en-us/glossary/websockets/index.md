_WebSocket_ is a {{Glossary("protocol")}} that allows for a persistent {{Glossary("TCP")}} connection between {{Glossary("Server", "server")}} and client so they can exchange data at any time.

Any client or server application can use WebSocket, but principally web {{Glossary("Browser", "browsers")}} and web servers. Through WebSocket, servers can pass data to a client without prior client request, allowing for dynamic content updates.
