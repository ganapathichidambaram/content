In the context of {{Glossary("CSS")}} (Cascading Style Sheets), the term **_media_** refers to the destination to which the document is to be drawn by the rendering engine.

Typically, this is a screen—but it may also be a printer, Braille display, or another type of device.

CSS offers several features that allow you to tweak your document's styles—or even offer different styles—according to the media **type** (such as screen or print, to name two) or media **capabilities** (such as width, resolution, or other values) of the viewer's device.
