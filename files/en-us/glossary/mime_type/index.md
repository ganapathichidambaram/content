A **MIME type** (now properly called "media type", but also sometimes "content type") is a string sent along with a file indicating the type of the file (describing the content format, for example, a sound file might be labeled `audio/ogg`, or an image file `image/png`).

It serves the same purpose as filename extensions traditionally do on Windows. The name originates from the {{glossary("mime","MIME")}} standard originally used in E-Mail.
